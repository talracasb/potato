              Watch in awe as your potato blazingly fastily compiles chromium
              so you can watch videos of potatoes dancing. I don't judge.
              Are you an epic gamer? Now, you can play minecraft with shaders on
              because you have far too much money, I mean seriously man, come on.
              Video editing? No problem! Use adobe software with it crashing
              less than 95% of the time! (90% is about as good as we can do, sorry.)

              Tooling so good you can make your potato into a motercycle so you can
              procede to your local farm and burn all of the carrots! Yes, you should
              do this and we 100% endorse burning carrots. Carrots are terrible vegetables
              that deserve to be destroyed at all costs. Install a flamethrower to obliterate
              any carrot you see! Easy access to memory so you can make sure
              you keep track of how many carrot's you have burned so far.
